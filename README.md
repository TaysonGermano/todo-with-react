## My process

For this modern Todo App, I wanted to demonstrate my CSS skill and also JS skills using reactjs. First I made sure the requirements were clear and after that, I implemented step-by-step solutions to each problem.
I detailed in a doc with components that should be created and what are their functionality as well as who will be the parent of each component. Also since I wanted the app to keep a consistent database, I chose to use localstore to save information about the app

### Built with

- CSS
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React-Router
- UUID

### What I learned

I'm always trying to get my CSS skills up to date and also learn some new tricks for designing better apps.
