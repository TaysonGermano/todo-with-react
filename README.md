## My process

For this modern Todo App I wanted to demostrate my css skill and also JS skills using reactjs. First I made sure the requiriments are clear and after that, I implemented step by step solution to each problem.
I detailled in a doc with components should be created and what are their functionality as well as who will be the parent of each component. Also since I wanted the app to keep a consistent database, I choose to use localStore to safe informations about the app

### Built with

- CSS
- LocalStorage
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- React-Router
- UUID

### What I learned

I'm always trying to get my css skills up to date and also learn some new tricks for design better apps and for this particular one, I learned a lot about flexbox and also about how to create a dark theme for web apps using css and js
